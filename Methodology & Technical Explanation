# Methodology & Technical Explanation

## Moving Averages

### Why We Use Them
Moving averages smooth out daily price noise to reveal true trend.

### Calculation
20-day MA = Sum of last 20 closing prices / 20
50-day MA = Sum of last 50 closing prices / 50

### Interpretation
- Price above MA = Uptrend
- Price below MA = Downtrend
- MA20 above MA50 = Strong uptrend

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

### Formula
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
Where RS = Average Gain / Average Loss over 14 days

### Meaning
- Values 0-100
- Above 70 = Overbought (sell signal)
- Below 30 = Oversold (buy signal)
- 30-70 = Neutral

## Volatility

### Formula
Volatility = Standard Deviation of daily returns

### Interpretation
Shows how much price jumps around:
- Low (<2%) = Stable, predictable
- High (>4%) = Risky, unpredictable

## Support & Resistance

### Support Level
Lowest price in recent period (price bounces up from here)

### Resistance Level
Highest price in recent period (price bounces down from here)

### Trading Use
- Buy near support (floor)
- Sell near resistance (ceiling)
